    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "##### In this project the goal was to scrape data from a website using, BeautifulSoup and selenium. The purpose is to gain the ability to find/gather data aside from the EDA processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources\n",
    "##### In this project we will be getting our data from https://ksa.yallamotor.com for new_cars. But the data is not enought nor answers our questions. So the data will be gathered from all the gulf countries where this site operates: KSA, UAE, KUWAIT, QATAR, BAHRAIN, OMAN and EGYPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gathering data from thie site gives us a sample of the total population which should give us an idea about the new car market in GULF area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why?\n",
    "##### We will be answering questions where would the car cost more, would the engine type affect the price...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsides.\n",
    "##### Unfortunately the data does not include any purchase history. Thus the models will be used on knowing what the would be priced based on features in different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models: \n",
    "##### Linear Regression, Regression and Logistic Regression.\n"
